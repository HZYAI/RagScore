    "The Space Shuttle program was a United States government spaceflight program that operated from 1981 to 2011. The program flew 135 missions over 30 years, using a fleet of five orbiters: Columbia, Challenger, Discovery, Atlantis, and Endeavour.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Space Shuttle was the first reusable spacecraft system. Each orbiter was designed to be reused up to 100 times. The shuttle launched vertically like a rocket but landed horizontally like an airplane on a conventional runway. The system consisted of three main components: the orbiter vehicle, two solid rocket boosters, and an external fuel tank.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first shuttle mission, STS-1, launched on April 12, 1981, with Columbia piloted by John Young and Robert Crippen. The mission lasted 2 days, 6 hours, and 20 minutes, orbiting the Earth 37 times before landing at Edwards Air Force Base in California.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program suffered two major disasters. On January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart 73 seconds after launch, killing all seven crew members. The cause was determined to be the failure of an O-ring seal in the right solid rocket booster, exacerbated by cold weather conditions. On February 1, 2003, the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated during re-entry, also killing all seven crew members. The cause was damage to the thermal protection system on the leading edge of the left wing, caused by a piece of foam insulation that broke off from the external tank during launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Space Shuttle played a crucial role in deploying and servicing the Hubble Space Telescope. Five servicing missions were conducted between 1993 and 2009, installing new instruments and replacing failed components. The shuttle also carried major components of the International Space Station into orbit, with 37 shuttle missions dedicated to ISS assembly between 1998 and 2011.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shuttle's cargo bay measured 18.3 meters long and 4.6 meters in diameter, capable of carrying up to 27,500 kilograms to low Earth orbit. The Canadarm, a robotic arm built by Canada, was used to deploy and retrieve satellites and assist with construction tasks in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notable shuttle missions include STS-31, which deployed the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990, and STS-71, the first shuttle-Mir docking mission in 1995. The shuttle also carried the European Spacelab module and launched interplanetary probes including Galileo to Jupiter and Magellan to Venus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The total cost of the Space Shuttle program was approximately $196 billion in 2011 dollars, making it one of the most expensive spaceflight programs in history. The average cost per mission was roughly $1.5 billion. After the program ended in 2011, the remaining orbiters were sent to museums: Discovery to the Smithsonian, Atlantis to the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex, and Endeavour to the California Science Center."
